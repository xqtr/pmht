You can add the repositories to your box in several ways. Here's a quick how-to, you can step through it or look for full details on adding PPA's on my Launchpad Page.

Open a terminal window (commands may be typed directly or pasted into it) and:

    Remove old sdlmame repositories (if any):

    sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sdlmame4ubuntu.*

    Add the main repository for unofficial builds:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:c.falco/mame

    (optionally) add the repository for "u"(nstable) builds:
    (Skip this step to stick with main, stable, not-"u" releases!)

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:c.falco/umame

    Now update the information on your box:

    sudo apt-get update

    Finally install the package from the repository:

    sudo apt-get install mame

The update manager will now take care of upgrading the package for you each time a new release is available! :)
